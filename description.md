##wQAA
wQAA is an analysis tool for Molecular Dynamic protein simulations.  It is currently developed entirely in python.  The current flow consists of:
* Data Extraction
* Alignment (Depending on Analysis)
* Dimensionality Reduction
while computing statistics along the way.  It provides the option to work in the Dihedral or Coordinate bases, and allows full customization of inputs.
